# forum-theme

This is the theme for the Better Century forum. At Better Century we tackle the big environmental crisis-es of our time by empowering people

We crowdsource solutions for people, organisations and communities to to take action through tiny changes of behaviour to big purchases of new technology. 

We connect people so they can learn from one another, and we share what weâ€™re doing so people are inspired to do the same

Our mission is to make a Better Century, where improved use and sharing of resources creates an environment where all life thrives.
